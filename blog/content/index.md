# CueCannon Manifesto

## What
CueCannon is a platform for storytelling, asking "What would a theater-of-the-web look like?" 

## Why
People enjoy storytelling and acting, especially when you remove their fear of missing cues or forgetting lines. It's an opportunity to listen to each other and the stories we carry, as well as practicing jumping into someone else's shoes. 

## How
CueCanon is made in Elm, a delightful language for the web. The interface is detached from the backend to allow experimentation with various backends like libp2p, lamdera, and more mainstream options of course. It's white label, and will have an open license so others can make apps and variations which fit their needs. 

One goal of the project is to be an easy way to get into programming. To that end, their will be gitpod setups which help a user new to programming make changes, as well as regular community pairing sessions.
